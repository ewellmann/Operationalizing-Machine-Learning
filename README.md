# Operationalizing-Machine-Learning

The Operationalizing Machine Learning project focuses on deploying and operationalizing a machine learning model using Microsoft Azure. The goal of this project is to showcase the end-to-end process of deploying a machine learning model as a REST API and creating a pipeline for automated model training and deployment.
This project involves several key components and steps. 

1. creating an Azure ML Workspace and configuring the necessary resources. 
2. train a machine learning model using Azure AutoML, which automates the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
3. deploy it as a REST API endpoint using Azure Container Instances (ACI). This will allow you to interact with the model and make predictions using HTTP requests.
4.  enable Application Insights, which provides monitoring and logging capabilities. This will allow to track the performance and usage of the model endpoint.
5. create a pipeline using Azure ML SDK to automate the model training and deployment process. This pipeline will include the necessary steps to train the model, register it, and deploy it as a REST API endpoint.
6. create a screencast video demonstrating the entire process of deploying the machine learning model, including the working deployed model endpoint, the deployed pipeline, the available AutoML model, and successful API requests to the endpoint with a JSON payload.



## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Screenshot documentation
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
